Mod for Medieval Total War 2

This Medieval Total War 2 adds a bunch of small changes to the game to make 
things more excitinig.

By "exciting" I mean (mostly) "different". After playing a lot of MWT2, I found
 myself in a bit off a slump. This mod adds a bunch of things I thought wouold 
be cool to enhance play or just changes things up a bit.

Features:
Floods are disabled. This is to avoid game bug where the flood does not end at
the end of a turn.
